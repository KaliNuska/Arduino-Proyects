# Introduction:
Thank you for purchasing the Earthshine Electronics
Arduino Starter Kit. You are now well on your way in
your journey into the wonderful world of the Arduino
and microcontroller electronics.
This book will guide you, step by step, through using
the Starter Kit to learn about the Arduino hardware,
software and general electronics theory. Through the
use of electronic projects we will take you from the
level of complete beginner through to having an
intermediate set of skills in using the Arduino.
The purpose of this book and the kit is to give you a
gentle introduction to the Arduino, electronics and
programming in C and to set you up with the
necessary skills needed to progress beyond the book
and the kit into the world of the Arduino and
microcontroller electronics.
The booklet has been written presuming that you have
no prior knowledge of electronics, the Arduino
hardware, software environment or of computer
programming. At no time will we get too deep into
electronics or programming in C. There are many
other resources available for free that will enable you
to learn a lot more about this subject if you wish to go
further. The best possible way to learn the Arduino,
after using this kit of course, is to join the Arduino
Forum on the Arduino website and to check out the
code and hardware examples in the
ʻ
Playground
ʼ
section of the Arduino website too.
We hope you enjoy using the kit and get satisfaction
from creating the projects and seeing your creations
come to life.
How to use it
The book starts off with an introduction to the Arduino,
how to set up the hardware, install the software, etc.
We then explain the Arduino IDE and how to use it
before we dive right into some projects progressing
from very basic stuff through to advanced topics. Each
project will start off with a description of how to set up
the hardware and what code is needed to get it
working. We will then describe separately the code
and the hardware and explain in some detail how it
works.
Everything will be explained in clear and easy to follow
steps. The book contains a lot of diagrams and
photographs to make it as easy as possible to check
that you are following along with the project correctly.
What you will need
Firstly, you will need access to the internet to be able
to download the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) and to also download the Code Samples
within this book (if you don
ʼ
t want to type them out
yourself) and also any code libraries that may be
necessary to get your project working.
You will need a well lit table or other flat surface to lay
out your components and this will need to be next to
your desktop or laptop PC to enable you to upload the
code to the Arduino. Remember that you are working
with electricity (although low voltage DC) and
therefore a metal table or surface will first need to be
covered in a non-conductive material (e.g. tablecloth,
paper, etc.) before laying out your materials.
Also of some benefit, although not essential, may be a
pair of wire cutters, a pair of long nosed pliers and a
wire stripper.
A notepad and pen will also come in handy for drawing
out rough schematics, working out concepts and
designs, etc.
Finally, the most important thing you will need is
enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. The Arduino is
designed as a simple and cheap way to get involved in
microcontroller electronics and nothing is too hard to
learn if you are willing to at least
ʻ
give it a go
ʼ
. The
Earthshine Design Arduino Starter Kit will help you on
that journey and introduce you to this exciting and
creative hobby
